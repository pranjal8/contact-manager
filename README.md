Project Description: Contact Manager CRUD Application

I built a Contact Manager CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using React, React Router DOM, and JSON Server. 
This project allows users to efficiently manage their contacts by performing the following actions:

Technologies Used:
 -React for building the user interface and managing state.
 -React Router DOM for handling page routing and navigation between different views.
 -JSON Server for providing a mock backend to handle contact data and simulate server interaction.
  This project demonstrates my ability to create dynamic, full-stack-like applications with React, enabling users to perform real-world 
  operations while working with client-server communication.
